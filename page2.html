                <li>The capital of the Valle del Cauca is a city whose tourist attractions have their own history, active cultural life, and musical rhythms that are famed around the world.</li>
                <li>Cali is known by the rest Colombia as the "Rumba Capital" and by the world as the "Salsa Capital", thanks to its characteristic street parties and dance.</li>
                <li>Of course, one of the best things to do in Cali is party, especially in the Juanchito area, where there are plenty of places to dance and a unique atmosphere that will get you moving your feet.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Colombia's famed coffee is often the star of the show, but the country's cuisine extends much further than its famed cuppas. While typical rice-and-bean combinations appear on every menu, expect to indulge in flavorful culinary specialties specific to Medellín. </li>
                <li>Above the clouds that hug Medellín’s outskirts – and just a short cable car ride away – mountaintop Parque Arví awaits as an eco-tourist’s paradise. The park, along with in-city green spaces like the Jardín Botánico de Medellín, helps position Medellín as an ideal spot for combining city breaks and outdoor escapes. </li>
                <li>Like many cities in Latin America, Medellín is the kind of place that rumbas in the streets ‘til dawn, but still rises with the early birds for a tinto and the morning paper. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Cartagena, a gorgeous fishing village on Colombia's Caribbean coast, has excellent beaches, a historic old town and beautiful colonial architecture. </li>
                <li>What makes this city unique? Santa Marta's beautiful terrain is its most distinguishing feature: its unforgettable landscapes in which the green foliage, blue sea, yellow sun and sand, and the contrast between the beaches and the white-peaked Sierra Nevada, make Santa Marta a must-see destination.</li>
                <li>Santa Marta is pure flavor. The city's diversity is evident in its landscape, people, and each and every aspect of its culture; it is a destination that truly embraces its visitors and makes them feel at home.</li>
